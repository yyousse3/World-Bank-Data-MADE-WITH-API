Worked in a team to design a world data UI, utilizing multiple design patterns
Users select a country, a analysis, and a timespan, the program will check to see if said data is available, and then display the results using graphs and charts
Data is retrieved using an REST API from the World Data Bank Repository
Patterns such as chain of responsibility was used to handle different requests from user, and the facade method was used to hide the backend code from the front end
